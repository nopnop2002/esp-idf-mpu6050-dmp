# MPU6050_KALMAN
This demo shows roll and pitch angles in 3D without using a DMP.   
Calculate roll and pitch using the very famous KalmanFilter.   
Since the MPU6050 does not have a magnetic sensor, yaw cannot be calculated.   
No drift occurs at rest.   
I used [this](https://github.com/TKJElectronics/KalmanFilter) library.   
I used [this](https://github.com/TKJElectronics/Example-Sketch-for-IMU-including-Kalman-filter/tree/master/IMU/MPU6050) as a reference.
